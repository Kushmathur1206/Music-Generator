# PyTorch "mounts" the tensor in the CUDA context for the GPU with the **SAME
# INDEX** as on the sender. This works if all processes use CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
# to limit themselves to a single GPU (which thus has index 0 everywhere) but in
# all other cases it's a mess. Hence we use our own reductions (which wrap the
# ones from PyTorch) to use the right devices.

# We need all processes to exchange a few strings with their addresses (in order
# to be able to connect to each other). The solution for this kind of things in
# PyTorch is a Store (TCPStore or FileStore) but we cannot create one ourselves
# (we don't know which addr/port/file to use, since the default one is already
# being used by PyTorch's global store) nor can we extract one from the
# ProcessGroup (since there's no API to do so). We thus resort to using the PG
# itself to exchange data, which is overkill (we need to store the pickled data
# into tensors and send it to the GPU). On top of that, it introduces one more
# catch: it doesn't work in inference mode because of something about modifying
# tensors inplace. I couldn't find a way to temporarily disable inference mode
# (although it's supposed to be possible) however inference mode is thread-local
# so we can dodge it by offloading the collective call to another thread. I hate
# all this so much.
