The training data for the model will consist of a collection of piano Kern files obtained from the Deutschl dataset. 
Its task is be able to anticipate the next note in a sequence based on the notes it has already seen. 
In our model training, we'll utilize three variables to encode a note: pitch, step, and duration.
